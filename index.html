	<p>NYC Charter requires Community Boards to submit a Statement of Community District Needs along with Budget Requests annually. These documents help city agencies determine where funding is allocated and serve as a guide to help explain specific community district needs.</p>
	
	<p>For Brooklyn Community Board 5, many of the top three pressing issues they’ve shared in their annual Statement of Community Needs are consistent and indicate many quality of life issues not addressed.</p>

		<p style="text-align:left;">According to CB5’s Statement of Community District needs, A high number of fast food options in neighborhoods with the zip code 11207 and 11208 demonstrates a need for more healthy food options and a focus on creating more access to full service restaurants.</p>

		<p> The statement uses an Epi Data Brief,  a collection of information collected by health department programs and projects, from the NYC Department of Mental Health and Hygiene, to show a need for more healthy food vendors in CB5 neighborhoods. The statement refers to data in Epi Data Brief findings that shows more than half of food vendors in the East New York zip codes were bodegas.</p>

		<p>“These numbers expose the devastating truth about how income levels in communities of color dictate the quality of services and products in neighborhoods across this city. It is also noted in the Epi Data Brief that for every 1 grocery store in the 11208 zip code, there are 5 fast food restaurants and 10 bodegas,” the statement reads.</p>

		<p>CB5 requests more funding to help bring more healthy food options into its neighborhoods and minimize the harm done by not having accessibility to restaurants.</p>

	<p style="text-align:left; ">A lack of communication between the community and building developers was another cause for concern listed in CB5’S Statement of Community Needs. The statement claims the district isn’t yet ready for major development changes and needs to be addressed when city agencies like HPD and DCP want to begin large development based projects.</p>

	<p>“We have larger development projects in our district that still have vacant ground floor commercial spaces because they are not being marketed to encourage local business participation or cooperative work environments that can guarantee consistent rent for the land-owner while opening up opportunities for embryo businesses share the cost of overhead,” according to the statement.</p>

	<p style="text-align:left; ">“The concept of public housing should not be synonymous with garbage,” CB5 stated in the final of three major issues needed to be addressed for the 2021 fiscal year.</p>

	<p>The failure to remove garbage on a consistent basis in New York City Housing Authority housing developments were listed as a top reason for litter in the streets and other rodent infestation issues. A request for larger and more frequent maintenance staff in NYCHA developments was made in the statement with an emphasis on creating a better quality of life for residents.</p>

<h4>This Year</h4>
<p> The three issues regarding affordable housing, cultural facilities and programs and unemployment appear in CB5’s Statement of District needs in this year, 2019 and 2018. The inclusion of three specific issues across three years indicates long term issues that were expected to be handled this year, but the impact of the coronavirus pandemic leaves the status of progress on these issues unknown.

<h3 id="Affordable Housing" class="main-content">Affordable housing</h3>
	<p style="align-content:left">The issues surrounding affordable housing continues despite the CB identifying the issue for years. In the statement, it claims,”With over 48% of the residents of the district being rent-burdened, the need for a truly comprehensive formula for affordable housing is still a very pressing need.” The figures given mean less than half of residents in Brooklyn’s District 5 live paycheck-to-paycheck from spending on rent and exposes one of the other issues they highlight with unemployment. </p>

</div>
<div id="content">
<h3 id="Cultural Facilities" class="main-content">Cultural Facilities and Programs</h3>
	<p style="align-content:left"> The cultural facilities and program issues fall under the category of maintaining businesses and organizations known to East New York. In the statement, CB5 points to a lack of arts and music programs in their school district. The goal would be to create a greater emphasis on art studies in schools and possibly more funding to provide the district resources.</p>

	<p>“School District 19 in Community Board 5 houses some of the most beautiful school buildings in the city, however the cultural arts and music programs in the schools are scarce, if they exist at all. A very clear solution to this issue - the arts/music programs must be returned to our schools to allow for greater exposure to cultural education for our children,” the statement reads. </p>

	<p>The statement also references four Brooklyn Public Library facilities in East New York to encourage the enhancement of culturally diverse materials and programs and maintain the residents in the district. </p>

<div class="Unemployment">

<div id="content">
<h3 id="Unemployment" class="main-content">Unemployment</h3>
	<p style="align-content:left"> Unemployment and job loss remains a top issue in CB5. According to part of the statement of distinct needs, “Over 32% of the district's residents earn incomes that fall below the poverty threshold for New York City.” </p>
	<p>The solution to the unemployment issues includes more employers opening their applications to East New York residents and more training for job seekers who continue to struggle. Developments like Gateway Center provide a large assortment of jobs in retail, but those opportunities aren't connected to the East New York communities and there’s a need for more stable long term employment options. </p>
